This assignment I implement rotate and collison with plane.
My program can change RK4 or Simple way.
I also use professor's dichotomy way to detect collision

Most situation it works fine, some specific angle will go through plane ~_~.

Keys:

A -- start;
K -- fall down
R -- reset
C -- change simulation function RK4 - Simple
T -- throw random
